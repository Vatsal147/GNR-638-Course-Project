- Paper Link: https://doi.org/10.1007/s11263-020-01303-4

The mentioned results in the PPT can be obtained as follows:
- There are three tasks implemented each having their own .ipynb file on the Github page in the link mentioned below. These are denoising.ipynb, inpainting.ipynb and super_resolution.ipynb. Open these files in colab using the link mentioned below and then they can be directly run to obtain the required results
- The written code Github repository link: https://github.com/Vatsal147/GNR-638-Course-Project
- To run the above code in Google Colab click here [Code](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Vatsal147/GNR-638-Course-Project).

## Required libraries
- python = 3.7
- pytorch = 1.10.0
- numpy
- scipy
- matplotlib
- scikit-image
- jupyter

##Note 
- The structure and implementation of the code used in this project was referenced by the actual code available online for this paper.  However, it was not directly copied.
- Since out model doesnâ€™t require a general pattern of learning parameters directly but rather independently optimises every image, it does not have a common model to save. The code submitted can be checked for a general input by providing any other image as input to obtain the corresponding output.
